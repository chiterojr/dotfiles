# .dotfiles

Inspired by some of the most awesome repositories for dotfiles, I've created this
one to help me with my helpful configurations and scripts

## Install

Run this:

```sh
cd ~
git clone <repository> .dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/install-home
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles`.
